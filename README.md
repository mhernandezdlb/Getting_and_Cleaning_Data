# Files
CodeBook.md: A file that describes the variables, data, and steps to clean up the data
run_analysis.R: Prepares the data by:
- Merging training and the test sets with subjects and activity codes.
- Selecting columns that contain mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
- Changing activity codes for activity descriptions.
- Labeling the data set with more descriptive variable names.
- Creating an independent tidy dataset averaging all the variables grouped by subject and activity
- Creating a file "tidy_data.txt with a table with the previous dataset.
